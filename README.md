# Neuroscience Simulation Notebook 

This repository is for my personal notes during my online course on Edx. 



This Simulation Neuroscience course is the first in a series of three. Others following this one are being developed now: Simulating the microcircuit and Reconstructing the microcircuit.

The first week is an introductory week, in which we'll explainÂ the principles and approach of Simulation Neuroscience. We created several practice quizzes after the videos to test your knowledge of the field, and we will end the week with a graded quiz.

Starting in week 2, we will not only have video lectures and quizzes, but will also offer you specific tutorials on how to work with the Simulation Neuroscience tools from the Human Brain Project. And to help you master these tools, we have included several practice assignments and graded assignments. In this week you will create your own virtual working space on the HBP platform and work on your assignments in the HBP collaboratory. The week ends with a graded quiz and a graded assignment.

From week 3 onward we will start with the actual development of a single neuron model, using Jupyter notebooks in the HBP collaboratory and the HBP simulation tools. You will create a ball and stick neuron, add synapses, and test the models' behaviour. You will learn how to validate the model against experimental data, and optimise parameters when experimental data is lacking. These weeks will also end with a graded quiz and a graded assignment.
