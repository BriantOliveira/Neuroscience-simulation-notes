# WEEK 1

### Approaches to Study the brain

* Experiment - observe

  * Normal brain - genes to behavior 
  * Diseased brain - toxin, drugs, lesions, mutations, degeneration

* Theory - hypothesize

  * Informatics - trends, correlations and patterns in data.

  * Theoretical neuroscience - explain data, predicts outcomes

  * Computational Neuroscience - minimal models that fits specific experimental data.

  * Applied neuroscience - use it in medicine and engineering.

* Simulation - unify

  * Consider every detail of the brain

  * Integrate data according to current knowledge

  * Fill gaps using hypotheses

##### QUIZ

##### What are the main approaches to study the brain?

* Observe via experements
* Hypothesize by creating theories 
* Unify the knowledge by simulation 

##### What is measured by experimental neuroscience?

Everything from micro-components of the cells to higher order properties such as behavior. 

**Which of the following are part of theoretical neuroscience?**

* computational neuroscience: creating minimal model that fit specific experimental data 
* Informatics neuroscience: looking at trend and patterns in data

**What is the main caveat of individual research?**

Difficulty to produce experimental results

**Which of the following assertions about large scale brain mapping projects \(e.g. Allen institute, human connectome project\) are true?**

* Large scale brain mapping project data is generated using standardize methods to measure components of the cell. 
* Large scale brain mapping project data span the whole brain 
* Large scale brain mapping project data can be used for simulation neuroscience 

**Which is the best approach to study the brain?**

All approaches are extremely valuable and form a global approach to study the brain 

**Why are simulations so important in engineering?**

Because they allow to bypass costly and often unfeasible run test

**Why is understanding the brain a big data problem that requires simulations?**

Because all the above interact in extremely complex ways.
