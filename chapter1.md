### Approaches to Study the brain

* Experiment - observe

  * Normal brain - genes to behavior 
  * Diseased brain - toxin, drugs, lesions, mutations, degeneration

* Theory - hypothesize

  * Informatics - trends, correlations and patterns in data.

  * Theoretical neuroscience - explain data, predicts outcomes

  * Computational Neuroscience - minimal models that fits specific experimental data.

  * Applied neuroscience - use it in medicine and engineering.

* Simulation - unify

  * Consider every detail of the brain

  * Integrate data according to current knowledge

  * Fill gaps using hypotheses

##### QUIZ

##### What are the main approaches to study the brain?

* Observe via experements
* Hypothesize by creating theories 
* Unify the knowledge by simulation 

##### What is measured by experimental neuroscience?

Everything from micro-components of the cells to higher order properties such as behavior.

**Which of the following are part of theoretical neuroscience?**

* computational neuroscience: creating minimal model that fit specific experimental data 
* Informatics neuroscience: looking at trend and patterns in data

**What is the main caveat of individual research?**

Difficulty to produce experimental results

**Which of the following assertions about large scale brain mapping projects \(e.g. Allen institute, human connectome project\) are true?**

* Large scale brain mapping project data is generated using standardize methods to measure components of the cell. 
* Large scale brain mapping project data span the whole brain 
* Large scale brain mapping project data can be used for simulation neuroscience 

**Which is the best approach to study the brain?**

All approaches are extremely valuable and form a global approach to study the brain

**Why are simulations so important in engineering?**

Because they allow to bypass costly and often unfeasible run test

**Why is understanding the brain a big data problem that requires simulations?**

Because all the above interact in extremely complex ways.

#### **The principles of simulation neuroscience**

#### 1 \) Dense Reconstruction from sparse data

The first important principle is that we have to do dense reconstructions dense, very detailed reconstructions and we have to do it from spares data. So, we will forever have spares data. No matter how much data we collect, it will forever be spare in terms of experimental. So, the problem we have to solve is how do we get a complete picture from spares data . So the first principles of simulation neuroscience is we have to establish the strategy from going to a little bit of datato using whatever knowledge we have of how the pieces fit together to build algorithms and algorithmically build the circuit.

* Spares Biological Data \(ideally Strategic data\).

* Constraints and principles

* Algorithms



Random System 

* Need to measure every pixel 
* no principles needed 
* Blind/ explicit reconstruction

Organized System 

* Do not need to measure every pixel 
* Principles needed 
* Algorithmic reconstruction 



The challenge is to find the minimum data you need. The smallest data set, not the largest data set. The real science is to say what is the least amount of data that I need to be able to reconstruct it. That is a **compression algorithm. **To reconstruct an image, In this case you wont need to measure everything, but you will need the principles an dthat is what drives simulation neuroscience. And the you algorithmically reconstruct it.
